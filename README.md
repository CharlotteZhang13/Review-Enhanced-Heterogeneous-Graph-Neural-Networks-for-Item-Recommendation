# Review-Enhanced-Heterogeneous-Graph-Neural-Networks-for-Item-Recommendation
Current GNN models are mostly homogeneous, exploiting only the relationships between users and items, and oftentimes model interactions using only rating information high in data sparsity. Therefore, we propose a review-enhanced heterogeneous graph neural framework to jointly model ratings and reviews.
